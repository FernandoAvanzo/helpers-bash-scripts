> **Battery Impact:** The speaker amplifiers are only powered on during active audio playback. When idle, the amps draw ~10μA per chip — effectively zero battery impact. The driver uses HDA playback hooks to enable the amps when audio starts and disable them when it stops. When native kernel support eventually lands (no confirmed timeline yet — see below), this package will auto-remove itself.

> **Secure Boot Users:** If you have Secure Boot enabled (most laptops do by default), you **must** enroll a Machine Owner Key (MOK) before the driver modules will load. If you've never installed a DKMS or out-of-tree kernel module before, you will need to complete a **one-time MOK enrollment** that involves a reboot and typing a password in a blue setup screen. See the [Secure Boot Setup](#secure-boot-setup) section below — **do this before running the install script**.

## The Problem

Samsung Galaxy Book4 laptops using **MAX98390 speaker amplifiers** have no audio output from the built-in speakers on Linux. The headphone jack works fine, but the laptop speakers are completely silent.

**Tested on:**
- Samsung Galaxy Book4 Ultra — Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, Kernel 6.17.0-14-generic (HWE)
- Samsung Galaxy Book4 Ultra — Fedora 43, Kernel 6.18.9 (community-confirmed)
- Samsung Galaxy Book5 Pro — Speaker fix works, mic continues to work (community-confirmed)

The upstream PR was also reported working on Galaxy Book4 Pro, Pro 360, and Pro 16-inch by other users — this fix should work on those models too.

> **Book5 owners:** The speaker fix works on Galaxy Book5 Pro models and the built-in microphone continues to work after installation (confirmed on Ubuntu and Fedora). The install script auto-detects the number of amplifiers present on your model.

> **Arch-based distros (CachyOS, Manjaro, etc.):** The built-in mic on Book5 models requires SOF firmware, which Arch does not install by default. If your mic doesn't work, install it: `sudo pacman -S sof-firmware` and reboot.

> **Fedora users:** The install script auto-detects Fedora (DNF) and configures DKMS module signing using the akmods MOK key. If no key exists, it generates one and prompts for enrollment.

This affects systems with:
- **HDA Codec**: Realtek ALC298 (subsystem ID `0x144dc1d8` or similar Samsung variants)
- **Speaker Amps**: 4x Maxim MAX98390 connected via I2C (addresses `0x38`, `0x39`, `0x3c`, `0x3d`)
- **Kernel**: 6.x series (tested on 6.17.0-14-generic, Ubuntu 24.04)

### Root Cause

The stock kernel is missing three things needed to drive these amps:

1. **`serial-multi-instantiate`** doesn't know about the `MAX98390` ACPI device ID, so it doesn't enumerate all 4 amplifiers
2. **`snd_hda_codec_alc269`** has no quirk entry for Samsung's MAX98390 subsystem IDs, so it never sets up the HDA side-codec component master
3. **`snd-hda-scodec-max98390`** (the actual amp driver) doesn't exist in the kernel tree yet

An upstream fix is being developed at [thesofproject/linux PR #5616](https://github.com/thesofproject/linux/pull/5616), but has not yet been submitted to mainline Linux via the ALSA mailing list. There is no confirmed timeline for when native support will land — it could still be a ways out.

## What This Fix Does

This is a **DKMS out-of-tree driver package** that provides the missing `snd-hda-scodec-max98390` driver. It works around the other two missing pieces (serial-multi-instantiate and alc269 quirk) by:

- **Manually creating I2C devices** for the 3 amps that ACPI doesn't enumerate (the first amp at `0x38` is created by ACPI automatically)
- **Enabling the amps during driver probe** rather than relying on HDA playback hooks (which require the missing alc269 quirk)
- **Loading DSM (Dynamic Speaker Management) firmware** with separate woofer/tweeter configurations

### Speaker Layout

| I2C Address | Component Index | Type | Channel |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x38` | 0 | Woofer | Left |
| `0x39` | 1 | Woofer | Right |
| `0x3c` | 2 | Tweeter | Left |
| `0x3d` | 3 | Tweeter | Right |

### What Gets Installed

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `snd-hda-scodec-max98390.ko` | Core HDA side-codec driver (init, DSM, component binding) |
| `snd-hda-scodec-max98390-i2c.ko` | I2C transport driver (probe, regmap, ACPI matching) |
| `/usr/local/sbin/max98390-hda-i2c-setup.sh` | Creates I2C devices for amps 2-4 on boot |
| `/usr/local/sbin/max98390-hda-check-upstream.sh` | Checks for native kernel support; auto-removes this package when found |
| `/etc/systemd/system/max98390-hda-i2c-setup.service` | Systemd service: runs I2C setup on boot |
| `/etc/systemd/system/max98390-hda-check-upstream.service` | Systemd service: upstream detection on boot |
| `/etc/modules-load.d/max98390-hda.conf` | Ensures modules load on every boot |
| `/usr/src/max98390-hda-1.0/` | DKMS source tree (auto-rebuilds on kernel updates) |

## Installation

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install dkms linux-headers-$(uname -r)

# Fedora
sudo dnf install dkms kernel-devel

# Arch / CachyOS / Manjaro
sudo pacman -S dkms linux-headers i2c-tools
```

> **Arch-based distros:** The install script auto-detects `pacman` and will auto-install `i2c-tools` if missing. However, `dkms` and `linux-headers` must be installed manually before running the script (the correct headers package depends on your kernel — e.g., `linux-headers` for the default kernel, `linux-lts-headers` for LTS, `linux-zen-headers` for Zen).

### Install

```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd speaker-fix
sudo ./install.sh
sudo reboot
```

The install script will:
1. Verify MAX98390 hardware is present (refuses to install on unsupported systems)
2. Build the kernel modules via DKMS (auto-signs for Secure Boot if MOK keys are configured)
3. Install systemd services and module autoload config
4. DKMS will auto-rebuild the modules on every kernel update

### Test Without Reboot

```bash
sudo ./install.sh
sudo systemctl start max98390-hda-i2c-setup.service
# Speakers should work immediately
```

### Uninstall

```bash
sudo ./uninstall.sh
sudo reboot
```

## Automatic Upstream Detection

A systemd service runs on every boot to check if the running kernel has gained native MAX98390 support. It checks three conditions:

1. `serial-multi-instantiate` has a `MAX98390` alias
2. `snd_hda_codec_alc269` contains the `alc298-samsung-max98390` quirk string
3. `snd-hda-scodec-max98390` exists in the kernel module tree (not just DKMS)

**When all three pass**, the service automatically removes the entire DKMS workaround — modules, services, scripts, everything. Speakers continue working that session (modules are already loaded in memory), and on the next reboot the native kernel driver takes over. No user interaction needed.

## How It Works (Technical Details)

### The Workaround

The upstream PR (#5616) touches 5 areas of the kernel:

1. `drivers/acpi/scan.c` — built-in, can't be changed without recompiling the kernel
2. `drivers/platform/x86/serial-multi-instantiate.c` — adds MAX98390 enumeration
3. `sound/pci/hda/patch_realtek.c` — adds Samsung quirk entries to alc269
4. `sound/soc/codecs/max98390.c` — exports regmap config
5. `sound/hda/codecs/side-codecs/` — new MAX98390 HDA driver (this package)

This DKMS package only implements #5 (the new driver) and works around #1-#4:

- **Instead of scan.c + serial-multi-instantiate**: A systemd service dynamically finds the I2C bus via ACPI and creates the missing I2C devices via sysfs `new_device`
- **Instead of the alc269 quirk**: The driver binds as an HDA component and uses playback hooks to enable/disable the amps on demand
- **Instead of the exported regmap**: A local `regmap_config` with `REGCACHE_NONE` is defined in the driver headers

### Power Management

The driver uses HDA playback hooks to control the amplifiers:

- **Playback starts** (`HDA_GEN_PCM_ACT_OPEN`) → amps enable (`GLOBAL_EN=0x01`, `AMP_EN=0x81`)
- **Playback stops** (`HDA_GEN_PCM_ACT_CLOSE`) → amps disable (`GLOBAL_EN=0x00`, `AMP_EN=0x80`)
- **On init** → amps start in disabled state (no power draw until audio plays)

The MAX98390 draws ~10μA per chip in disabled state — effectively zero battery impact when idle.

### I2C Bus Detection

The I2C setup script doesn't hardcode a bus number. It dynamically finds the correct bus by:
1. Searching `/sys/bus/i2c/devices/` for any device matching `MAX98390`
2. Following symlinks to find the parent I2C adapter
3. Falling back to ACPI device path resolution

This makes it portable across Galaxy Book4 Pro, Pro 360, Ultra, and Book5 models.

### Secure Boot

DKMS handles module signing automatically if MOK (Machine Owner Key) keys are configured. See the full [Secure Boot Setup](#secure-boot-setup) section below if you haven't set this up before.

## Sound Quality & EQ

The speakers will sound noticeably **thinner and quieter** compared to Windows. This is expected — it's not a bug in the driver.

### Why it sounds different from Windows

On Windows, Samsung's audio stack applies multiple layers of DSP (Digital Signal Processing) before audio reaches the speakers:

- **Dolby Atmos / Samsung Audio Wizard** — EQ curves, spatial audio, and loudness normalization tuned specifically for the laptop's speaker enclosure
- **Psychoacoustic bass enhancement** — DSP tricks that make your brain perceive bass frequencies that the small laptop speakers physically cannot produce
- **Dynamic range compression** — Makes quiet sounds louder and prevents distortion at high volumes
- **Speaker protection DSP** — Allows higher output levels without damaging the drivers

This fix provides the **raw hardware driver only** — it gets the speakers working, but none of the Windows audio processing exists on Linux. Additionally, the DSM (Dynamic Speaker Management) firmware in this package was extracted from a **Google Redrix Chromebook** (which uses the same MAX98390 amps), not from Samsung's Windows driver, so the tuning parameters are optimized for a different speaker enclosure.

### Improving sound quality with EasyEffects

You can significantly improve the sound using **[EasyEffects](https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects)**, a PipeWire-based audio effects application that provides EQ, bass enhancement, compression, and more:

```bash
# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install easyeffects

# Fedora
sudo dnf install easyeffects

# Arch / CachyOS / Manjaro
sudo pacman -S easyeffects
```

The Bass Enhancer effect requires Calf Studio Gear — install it if EasyEffects shows "Bass Enhancer Not Available":

```bash
# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install calf-plugins

# Fedora
sudo dnf install calf-plugins

# Arch / CachyOS / Manjaro
sudo pacman -S calf
```

#### Recommended: JackHack96 presets

The [JackHack96 EasyEffects Presets](https://github.com/JackHack96/EasyEffects-Presets) collection includes several presets tuned for different use cases. Install them all:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JackHack96/EasyEffects-Presets/master/install.sh)"
```

After installing, open EasyEffects and select a preset from the **Presets** dropdown (top-left). Personal preference varies, but the **"Advanced Auto Gain"** preset does a good job toning down the highs and allowing the bass to come through more, resulting in a more evenly distributed sound on these laptop speakers. Other presets to try:

- **Laptop** — Tuned specifically for laptop speakers
- **Loudness + Autogain Laptop** — Compensates for lower perceived volume
- **Bass Enhancing + Perfect EQ** — More aggressive bass boost

EasyEffects runs in the background and applies effects to all audio output. It won't perfectly match Windows' Dolby Atmos processing, but it makes a noticeable difference.

### When will it improve?

The [upstream kernel fix (PR #5616)](https://github.com/thesofproject/linux/pull/5616) includes proper Realtek ALC298 codec configuration through the `alc298-samsung-max98390` quirk, which will improve baseline audio quality with correct mixer levels and output routing. However, the PR is on GitHub for development only — it still needs to be submitted as patches via the [ALSA mailing list](https://mailman.alsa-project.org/mailman/listinfo/alsa-devel) to reach mainline Linux. There is **no confirmed timeline** and it could still be a ways out. Even with the upstream fix, matching Windows' full DSP stack would require Samsung to release Linux audio software, which is unlikely in the near term.

## Troubleshooting

**Speakers not working after install + reboot?**
```bash
# Check if modules loaded
lsmod | grep max98390

# Check if I2C devices were created
ls /sys/bus/i2c/devices/ | grep -i max

# Check service status
systemctl status max98390-hda-i2c-setup.service

# Check kernel log for driver messages
dmesg | grep -i max98390
```

**Modules not loading with Secure Boot? ("required key not loaded")**

This means the DKMS modules were built but not signed with your MOK key. Verify the signing config:

```bash
# Check if DKMS knows where your signing keys are
cat /etc/dkms/framework.conf /etc/dkms/framework.conf.d/*.conf 2>/dev/null | grep mok_

# You should see lines like:
# mok_signing_key=/etc/pki/akmods/private/private_key.priv    (Fedora)
# mok_signing_key=/var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.priv           (Ubuntu)
```

If no `mok_signing_key` / `mok_certificate` lines appear, create a drop-in config:

```bash
# Fedora
sudo mkdir -p /etc/dkms/framework.conf.d
sudo tee /etc/dkms/framework.conf.d/akmods-keys.conf > /dev/null << 'EOF'
mok_signing_key=/etc/pki/akmods/private/private_key.priv
mok_certificate=/etc/pki/akmods/certs/public_key.der
EOF

# Then rebuild the modules
sudo dkms remove max98390-hda/1.0 --all
sudo dkms install max98390-hda/1.0
sudo reboot
```

> **Note:** The exact key paths vary by distro. Ubuntu typically uses `/var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.priv` and `MOK.der`. Fedora uses `/etc/pki/akmods/private/private_key.priv` and `public_key.der`. Check which files exist on your system.

**DKMS build fails on kernel update?**
```bash
# Check if headers are installed for the new kernel
sudo apt install linux-headers-$(uname -r)   # Ubuntu/Debian
sudo dnf install kernel-devel                 # Fedora

# Rebuild manually
sudo dkms build max98390-hda/1.0
sudo dkms install max98390-hda/1.0
```

## Secure Boot Setup

**If Secure Boot is disabled on your system, skip this section entirely.** Check with:

```bash
mokutil --sb-state
# "SecureBoot enabled" = you need to do this
# "SecureBoot disabled" = skip this section
```

Secure Boot prevents unsigned kernel modules from loading. DKMS on Ubuntu can auto-sign modules using a Machine Owner Key (MOK), but the key must be **enrolled in your firmware** first. This is a one-time process.

### Step 1: Check if MOK keys already exist

```bash
ls /var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.der /var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.priv 2>/dev/null
```

If both files exist, skip to Step 2. If not, Ubuntu's `shim-signed` package usually generates them automatically. If they're missing:

```bash
sudo apt install shim-signed
# Keys should now exist at /var/lib/shim-signed/mok/
```

### Step 2: Check if the MOK is already enrolled

```bash
mokutil --list-enrolled
```

If you see a key listed, you're already set — skip to the install. If it says "MokListRT is empty" or shows no keys, continue to Step 3.

### Step 3: Enroll the MOK key

```bash
sudo mokutil --import /var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.der
```

You'll be prompted to create a **one-time password**. Remember it — you'll need to type it on the next screen.

### Step 4: Reboot into MOK Manager

```bash
sudo reboot
```

On reboot, instead of booting normally, you'll see a **blue screen** (MOK Manager). This is expected:

1. Select **"Enroll MOK"**
2. Select **"Continue"**
3. Select **"Yes"**
4. **Type the password** you created in Step 3
5. Select **"Reboot"**

After this, your MOK is permanently enrolled. You never need to do this again — all future DKMS module builds (including kernel updates) will be auto-signed and load without issues.

### Step 5: Verify

After rebooting:

```bash
mokutil --list-enrolled | head -5
# Should show [key 1] with a SHA1 fingerprint
```

**Now you can run the install script.** If you already ran it before enrolling the MOK, just reboot — DKMS already signed the modules during install, they just couldn't load until the key was enrolled.
