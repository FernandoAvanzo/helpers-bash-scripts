# Theory Overview

## Direct Energy Conversion

Direct nuclear energy conversion extracts kinetic energy from charged particles using electrostatic fields instead of thermal cycles.

### Key Equations

- Debye Length:
  λ_D = sqrt(ε₀ kT / ne²)

- Child-Langmuir Law:
  J = (4/9) ε₀ √(2q/m) V^(3/2) / d²

- Lorentz Force:
  F = q(E + v × B)
